== TeamSquad

A web site for organising local and amateur sports leagues and competitions.

== Dependencies

* Rails v1.1.6 (obviously)
* Rcov gem

== Deployment on TextDrive

Deployment is handled by capistrano.

$ cap deploy

...or...

$ cap remote:deploy_with_migrations

...if database needs updating too.

== Temporary maintenance page

A temporary page can be stuck up if the site needs to be taken down for a 
short period for some reason.

$ cap remote:disable_web

...takes the site down, and...

$ cap remote:enable_web

== Testing

In addition to usual rails testing tasks the site makes use of Rcov for code
coverage analysis.
