  <h2>What's this then?</h2>
	<p>Your control panel lets you quickly access various administration tasks
		you can do for your organisation. Whilst you can do most things by following
		links littered around your site (like add fixtures and so on) there are
		some tasks that don't really fit anywhere else. You'll find those tasks
		here. Stuff like managing who is allowed to log in and alter your
		organisation's data.</p>

	<h2>All done?</h2>
